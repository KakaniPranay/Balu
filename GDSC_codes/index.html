                <b>Manga are comics or graphic novels originating from Japan. Most manga conform to a style developed in Japan in the late 19th century, and the form has a long history in earlier Japanese art.The term manga is used in Japan to refer to both comics and cartooning. Outside of Japan, the word is typically used to refer to comics originally published in the country.</b>

            <p><b>What is so special about Naruto?</b></p>
                <b>Naruto's signature technique, the Shadow Clone jutsu allows him to create what's essentially an army of himself and overpower most opponents. While most characters in the series can use this technique, Naruto can create far more clones than most others due to his larger-than-average chakra reserve.</b>
